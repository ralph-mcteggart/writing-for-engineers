# Resources
## Books I recommend
### Soft skills
- [Elements of Style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style) - standard college textbook for writing well. The stuff written in this book is rehashed everywhere. Implement the basics and you'll instantly become a better writer.
- [Presentation Zen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908456.Presentation_Zen) - a little dated but the ideas stand. How to present things in a digestible way (I didn't do this enough in this talk!)

## Videos
- [Writing lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) - really rich content. Probably needs watched a few times to let it all sink in

## Tools
### Tech style guides
- [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for technical docs
- [CMOS](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) for more generic writing
### Hemingway 
- [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to identify problematic sentences.
### Vim
I'm not a fanboy I promise.
There are quite a few Vim plugins for writing. I'm not going to list them all here but I do like [goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim). On a related note, junegunn has some other awesome plugins so check those out as well.
